A minimalist, readable, and performant programming language for the modern age

### **Design Goals:**
- **Performance**: Powered by Go-like performance characteristics.
- **Readability**: Focusing on the simplicity and readability of Python.
- **Flexibility**: Borrowing the flexible import/export model from JavaScript.
- **Type System**: Light, flexible typing like Go, with the option to declare types when necessary (similar to TypeScript but less complex).
- **Borrowing Model**: Inspired by Rust, but simpler and integrated into the language without needing a `mut` keyword.
- **Minimal Syntax**: No semicolons, no `func` keyword for functions, clean and concise.
